# leaf-disease-detection
#Designed and implemented a deep learning model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to detect and classify plant leaf diseases from image sequences. Preprocessed data with noise reduction, normalization, and feature extraction techniques to enhance model performance. Leveraged sequential data patterns by converting images into time-series representations, enabling the RNN to learn spatialâ€“temporal correlations for improved classification accuracy. Trained and validated the model on agricultural image datasets, achieving reliable detection across multiple disease categories. Integrated the model into an interactive interface for real-time disease prediction, aiding early intervention in precision agriculture.
